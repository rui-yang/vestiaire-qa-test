## :Notes
1. Login were conducted through API request instead of UI as I observed some inconsistency when trying to login via UI and also in general it should be done via API since the purpose of these test cases are not for testing login functionality.
2. Since there's limited timeframe, the tests are not abstracted enough, which should be done for the purpose of maintenance and readability.
